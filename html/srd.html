    <p><b>You are encouraged to present in your Faculty/Dept event AND this one.</b> SRD covers all levels and types of research activity such as
    <ul>
        <li>Literature reviews
        <li>Classroom based research
        <li>Individual projects
        <li>Group projects
        <li>And many more!
    </ul>

    <h2>Interested in Presenting?</h2>

    <p>Everyone is invited -- you don't have to be in a research course to present. Talk to your instructor and let them
       know that you are interested
       in showcasing your project. There will be seminars and on-line help sessions on developing your poster . So whether your
       entire class is involved, or just you, help is available. </p>

    <p>SRD will focus on posters and multi-media only this year. Oral presentations are typically part of the Faculty/Dept events noted above. So the options are:
    <ul>
        <li>Posters - 2&#189; x 3&#189; research posters or</li>
        <li>Multi-Media Presentations: (10 min max).</li>
    </ul>
    Posters are the most obvious choice. Authors stand nearby during the presentation period to explain or discuss their
    work with attendees.
    We are including multi-media this year by popular demand. Be sure to specify your exact requirements in your registration. </p>
    <p>Each poster and presentation will be accompanied by a half page written abstract which will be published in the
       on-line event program and archive. </p>

    <h2>Who's Invited?</h2>

    Everyone! Students, faculty, visitors-you name it, we want them there. We are encouraging instructors to fit this
    into their class schedules
    so that all students have a chance to attend.

    <h2>Applications</h2>

    <p>The <a href="studentregistration.php" target="_blank">registration form is available now</a>. There will be no limits on number
       of presenters - but the earlier you register the more help we can give you. We know that many projects will be
       in-progress when you apply, and maybe even when you present - but that's like any scholarly conference - most are
       works in progress.</p>

    <h2>Other Information</h2>

    <p>Check out some of the projects from previous years in our <a href='student_research.php'>archive.</a>.</p>
