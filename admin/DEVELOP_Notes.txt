New database: Funding List
- idea is to search on mega list-independent of deadline or opp.
- should be linked to deadline or opp locally for admin purposes
- 4 tiers for grouping. Top 3 are mandatory. If last one (grant) is missing use one above
- deadline of zero = unknown or blank
- set up reminder check for yearly updates. Take over from opp/deadline one
- deadline date of '1' = continuous intake, '0'= unknown, '2'=take offline (not this year...)
- 'occasional' - if TRUE then take offline after deadline (don't show or update)
- the idea is to ignore the year when displaying, (except 'occasional')
